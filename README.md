## Bio

Although I have only recently transitioned from a career in private educational administration and teaching, technology and web development has always been a mainstay focus. Throughout the last decade, for instance, I have been the Director of Technology for a school, authored and maintained 3 full-scale school websited, taught technology to students, and managed technology on the back end (Azure, Office365, firewalls, etc.). Additional, I have spend the last 5 year honing my skills through projects, challenges, real-life application, bootcamps, and specialized training.

Just recently, I have set forth on a new venture with two of my children. In collaboration, we have formed ***@media***, a business support technology company. Together, we offer services in graphic arts, web technologies, and data analysis.

Currently, my desire is to collaborate with a company or individual, either part or full time (preferably remote), in the area of frontend or fullstack web development. My goal is to gain more experience, grow in competency by learning from others, and contribute positively to a team.
